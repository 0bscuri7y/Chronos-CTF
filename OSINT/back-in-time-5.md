### Solution

From the github user homepage, we see also goes by as `SpideyPavitr`. A user with same username was present on instagram, and had posted an image of some highrise buildings. 

A quick reverse search took me to `Selamat Datang Monument` in Indonesia. From there I hopped onto google street view, and found the buildings shown in the image. I then identified the image angle and found the hotel from which the image could have been taken from. It was `Grand Hyatt Jakarta`. After a bit of formatting tries, `saic{grand_hyatt_jakarta}` worked!
