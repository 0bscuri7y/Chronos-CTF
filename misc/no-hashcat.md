
## üß© Challenge Description
We were given a single Yescrypt hash and asked to find the original password/flag. The hash format was:

```swift
$y$j9T$s/UaF7EiN0ylLVryw75Co1$6WdEcyhcU.f8Fa/HhKBHCPC7qUN3fSxbNR3izAHNvE6
```

The hint mentioned:

- The hash contains parts of the flag.
- The flag format follows saic{...}.

---

## üîç Approach

Initially, we attempted to identify the hash via Hashes.com. It confirmed the format as Yescrypt, noted by the $y$ prefix.

Since Hashcat doesn‚Äôt support this format, we pivoted to using John the Ripper, which supports cracking Yescrypt hashes under the --format=crypt option.

We then first copy this hash text to hash.txt

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Strategy
The password embedded in the hash follows a CTF flag format: saic{...}. Therefore, brute-forcing with a standard wordlist wouldn‚Äôt be ideal.

To maximize efficiency:

We generated a modified wordlist where each line wraps common words with the saic{} flag format.

We then used this list with John the Ripper to attempt a match.

## üß™ Steps

1. Prepare the Wordlist
```python
with open('/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt', 'r', encoding="latin-1") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

with open('modified_wordlist.txt', 'w') as f:
    for line in lines:
        f.write('saic{' + line.strip() + '}\n')
```

2. Crack the Hash with John
```bash
john --format=crypt --wordlist=modified_wordlist.txt hash.txt
```

```bash
--format=crypt: Required for Yescrypt hashes.

```
```bash
--wordlist: Uses the custom list we generated.
```
hash.txt: File containing the original Yescrypt hash.
